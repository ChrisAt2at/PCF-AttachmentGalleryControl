# Attachment Gallery Control

This is PCF control that shows images and pdf from attached notes and also can show note title and note text.

![Demo](https://github.com/OOlashyn/PCF-AttachmentGalleryControl/blob/master/Screenshots/gallery-v1.gif?raw=true)

**IMPORTANT: pdf.js update to v4 broke existing functionality (see issue [#36](https://github.com/OOlashyn/PCF-AttachmentGalleryControl/issues/36)). Unfortunately, this control was created before PCF was GA and fixing the issue while preserving correct naming is not possible. To solve this issue please delete previous solution and install the latest [1.0.0.1 release](https://github.com/OOlashyn/PCF-AttachmentGalleryControl/releases/)**

Update to version 1.0.0

* UI update - Using Office Fabric UI for icons.
* PDF Support - Added build-in pdf reader using pdf.js library.
* Note text - added ability for big text to reflow to next line.
* File download - added ability to download the file.
* Full Screen - open images and pdf files in full screen.
